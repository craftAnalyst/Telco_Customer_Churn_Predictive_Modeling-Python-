# Telco_Customer_Churn_Predictive_Modeling-Python-
This machine learning project uses python to develop a Customer Churn prediction model to aid a service provider company to determine most significant factors influencing customer retention to optimize better business strategies.  

Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning Model
I developed a predictive model to forecast customer churn in a telco dataset using supervised learning techniques. The project aimed to identify the most significant factors influencing
customer retention and optimize business strategies.

## Process:
▪️Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.  
▪️Model Building: Implemented a classification algorithm logistic regression achieving 77% accuracy.  
▪️Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.   

## Key Insights: 
Contract length and customer service satisfaction were crucial predictors of churn. The model provided valuable insights for retention strategies.  
## Tools: 
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Machine Learning Algorithms.  
This project showcases my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems. Code snippets and visualizations are available in my portfolio.
